# Project

This is the main rule that help for working with this project. 

## Language

- The library is written using `Python` language
- `just` is used to automate all the command and centralize them
- `devcontainer` is used to setup the workspace for developer
- `uv` is python build tool 
- All code need to be tested using `pytest`
- Everytime you write a new feature you need to write the equivalent test

# What is here?

`fastdataframe` is a moderm library that aim to join the world of `pydantic` with `dataframes`
The library aim to be a bridge between `pydantic` <-> `dataframe libraries` and a standard that can be use accross multiple implementation of dataframe like

- `Polars dataframe`
- `Polars lazyframe`
- `Pandas dataframe`
- `Pyarrow dataframe`
- 'pyiceberg`


The idea is similar to 
- `SQLModel` https://github.com/fastapi/sqlmodel/tree/main
- `Patito` https://github.com/JakobGM/patito

## Key capability

The core functionallity that we want to have are
- validate a dataframe from a pydantic model
- Transform a dataframe to return a enumeration of pydantic model
- Create a dataframe from a list of model with the right type
